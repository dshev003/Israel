## Introduction

Nepal is one of only a few countries in the world that successfully
integrated a rebel group into its political system, a process that has
yielded relatively peaceful results to the present day. From 1996 to
2006, the Nepalese people faced the tragedy of a [civil
war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_Civil_War) that destroyed
lives, communities and families alike. For the personal stories of those
affected, the [INSEC](https://www.insec.org.np/victim) database
comprehensively catalogues details on the thousands of dead, wounded and
missing of the conflict.
